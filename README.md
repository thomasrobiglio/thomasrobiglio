### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Thomas, I am interested in Complex Systems and Network Science. 

The two main projects I am currently working on on GitHub are:
- [XGI](https://github.com/xgi-org/xgi), a Python library that provides data structures and algorithms for modeling and analyzing complex systems with group (higher-order) interactions
- [RandTempNet](https://github.com/thomasrobiglio/RandTempNet_py3), a Python library to handle temporal networks and perform randomisation methods on their structure.

You can find more about me on my [personal website](https://thomasrobiglio.github.io).
